# Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e Character Generator

This project, written in ReactJS, uses tables from the 2003 release of the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook to generate first-level D&D characters.

Created characters can then be printed or exported as PDFs.

The app is styled in Bootstrap and is mobile-responsive.
